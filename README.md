# F1 Live Telemetry

A Windows desktop app that charts **Formula 1 telemetry live** (speed, throttle,
brake, RPM, gear) for one or several cars at once, with **distance on the X
axis** and one series per driver. Built with
[Fast-F1](https://github.com/theOehrly/Fast-F1), PySide6 and pyqtgraph.

![F1 Live Telemetry — Race mode replaying a race, with timing tower and track map](docs/screenshot.png)

**Times / Gap** — gap to a reference driver over the whole race, tyre
degradation per stint and the timing tower with pit stops and averages:

![Times / Gap mode with degradation analysis](docs/screenshot-gap.png)

**Quali comparison** — live laps against a target lap, with the cumulative
delta trace and per-sector/microsector delta cards updating in real time:

## Modes

| Mode | Behaviour |
|------|-----------|
| **Race** | Sliding window configurable in laps (½ to 20 or the whole session; default 1), plus free space on the right so the latest values and each series' label stay visible. The X axis is the **track position** ((lap − 1) × lap length + lap meter), so the same corner falls on the same vertical for every car: braking points line up even when a car runs behind. |
| **Race 2** | Fixed X axis from 0 to the last meter of the lap. Each series overwrites ("eats") its own previous-lap line as it advances, with a visible gap ahead of each car's cursor. |
| **Quali** | Comparison of the current lap against a **target lap** (any completed lap of any driver). Three levels: the channel traces (dashed target + live current laps), the **cumulative delta trace** (X = distance, Y = seconds gained/lost vs the target at every meter, X axes linked), and **per-driver cards** (up to 4, in a 2-column grid) with the total lap delta in large type and one row per sector: the sector chip on the left and its 8 microsectors aligned next to it — no horizontal scrolling; green = doing better, red = worse, and the most recently crossed microsector is highlighted. |
| **Times / Gap** | Gap chart against a reference driver (marked "(ref)" in the legend; X = **track position**, with "total distance / L\<lap\> +\<meters\>" ticks and a vertical line at every lap boundary; window configurable from ½ to 20 laps or the whole session; Y = seconds, **+ = slower than the reference at the same position, − = faster**) plus comparison tables ordered by track position: summary (P1..Pn, current lap, last, best, S1-S3, gap), lap times per driver, microsector deltas (24 splits, green/red cells) and per-corner minimum speeds. Sectors and microsectors are **rolling** (current lap in real time; until crossed, the value from one lap ago, dimmed) and each driver's most recently completed microsector is highlighted. |
| **Race trace** | Classic race-trace: each driver's cumulative gap against a **selectable reference** (the leader by default, or any driver), with **one point per official microsector** so the effect of every corner shows up, not just the per-lap cut. X = laps (configurable: last N laps or all), Y = seconds (configurable ±s or auto; losing time = the line drops). SC/VSC/flag periods are shaded in the background. |

## Data sources

The visualizer consumes two sources; going live against the F1 stream is the
**capturer's** job (its own executable, next section):

- **Replay (Fast-F1 historical)** — replays any real session (2018 onwards) as
  if it were live, with a speed multiplier (x1 to x25). The first load of a
  session downloads data (may take a few minutes); it is cached afterwards.
- **Capture (live / imported)** — follows a capture file written by the
  **capturer** with minimal delay (new lines are decoded as soon as they hit
  the disk, ~50 ms), whether it is a real live capture in progress or an
  imported one replayed as live. The visualizer **manages the capturer**:
  pressing Connect attaches immediately if a capture file is already
  growing; otherwise it **opens the capturer automatically** (if it is not
  already running — a heartbeat file tells) and stays waiting, connecting
  **by itself the moment data starts flowing** (start a live capture or an
  import in the capturer). The wait can be cancelled with the same button. The live client (SignalR Core against
  `livetiming.formula1.com/signalrcore`) decodes `CarData.z` (speed, RPM,
  gear, throttle, brake, DRS at ~4 Hz per car) and `Position.z`, integrates
  speed to obtain distance and takes lap numbers from `TimingData`. **Data
  only flows while an official session is running**, and the full stream
  requires an **F1TV subscription token** (sign in from the capturer). Every
  message is recorded to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\f1telem\recordings\`. The timeline
  lets you seek back anywhere in the session while the capture keeps
  growing, and the red **LIVE** button jumps back to the latest data.

(For development, `F1TELEM_DEV_SOURCES=1` adds the synthetic Demo and the
direct Live client to the source list.)

## Capturer

A companion app that ONLY captures the live stream to a file, so the
visualizer (this app, even multiple instances) can follow it live or rewind
without touching the network connection. It is a **separate executable**
(`F1TelemCapture.exe`, its own `capture\` folder with an independent
`_internal`) so the main app can be updated **without stopping a running
capture** — the auto-updater replaces the visualizer and leaves the capturer
untouched while it keeps recording (it updates the next time it is closed).

```powershell
F1TelemCapture.exe        # or: .\capture.ps1  ·  python -m f1telem --capture
```

### Import a recorded capture (replay as live)

The capturer's **Import capture…** button replays any recorded `.jsonl`
**as if the stream were arriving live**, transparently for the main app — it
follows the new file with its *Capture (recorded live)* source and cannot
tell real from imported. The model mirrors a real live session: you pick
**where real-time playback starts** (`hh:mm:ss`, e.g. `00:01:30`), the
**whole history from the race start up to that point is delivered
instantly** (the main app always gets the complete picture, exactly like
when it hooks into an ongoing live capture), and from there the data flows
chronologically at real speed — no pause, no rewind, just like a live feed.
Seeking around the received data is done in the main app's own timeline, as
always. Playback uses a single working file (`import_live.jsonl`),
overwritten on each import and removed on exit — replaying never piles up
new capture files.

It shows the output file, connection status and data counters, and offers
**Sign in with F1TV…** (browser flow, token shared with Fast-F1). Then open
the main app and pick the *Capture (recorded live)* source: it automatically
follows the most recent capture file.

### F1TV sign-in: setup and login procedure

**What you need**

- An active **F1TV Access/Pro/Premium subscription** (the live stream needs
  it; without a token the app still connects but data may be partial).
- A Chromium browser (Chrome/Edge/Brave) **on the same machine as the
  capturer** — the login hands the token to the app through `localhost`.
- The **companion extension** installed once (next section). The official
  *FastF1 Companion* extension is outdated — Chrome 130+ blocks its request
  to `localhost` (Local Network Access), which shows up as *"Could not
  connect to the local FastF1 application"* — so this repo ships its own
  drop-in replacement.

**Install the extension (once)**

1. Locate the `extension` folder: next to `F1LiveTelemetry.exe` in the
   release, or at the repo root.
2. Open `chrome://extensions` in Chrome, enable **Developer mode**
   (top-right toggle) and click **Load unpacked**.
3. Pick the `extension` folder — "F1 Live Telemetry Companion" appears in
   the list. Keep the folder where it is (Chrome loads it from there).
4. If you have the old *FastF1 Companion*, **disable it** in
   `chrome://extensions` — both react to the same sign-in URL and would
   race each other.
5. If the app's sign-in opens a different browser, either make Chrome your
   default browser or copy the sign-in URL shown in the capturer's status
   line into Chrome manually.

**Login procedure**

1. In the capturer press **Sign in with F1TV…** — the app starts a local
   listener and opens the sign-in URL in your browser (up to 15 minutes;
   keep the capturer open).
2. The extension takes you to the **Formula 1 account login** — sign in
   with your F1TV credentials (2FA included if you use it).
3. When the login lands on *my account*, the extension opens its **Connect**
   page and delivers the token to the app automatically — it declares
   `targetAddressSpace: "loopback"` (the Chrome 130+ requirement) and the
   app's local server answers with `Access-Control-Allow-Private-Network:
   true`, the two halves of the Local Network Access handshake.
4. The capturer's **F1TV** line switches to *"token found (authenticated)"*.
   Done — the token is stored in Fast-F1's `f1auth.json`, shared with
   anything else that uses Fast-F1, and reused on the next runs until it
   expires (then just sign in again).

**If the automatic delivery fails**

- The extension's Connect page offers **Open in the app**: the browser
  shows its native *"Open F1 Live Telemetry?"* dialog and hands the token
  straight to the executable through the `f1telemetry://` link (the
  capturer registers it per-user on start, no admin needed) — the running
  capturer picks it up within seconds.
- It also shows the token with a **Copy** button: copy it, then press
  **Paste token…** in the capturer and paste.
- Without any extension, **Paste token…** always works: sign in at
  `f1tv.formula1.com`, open DevTools (F12) → **Application** → **Cookies**
  → `https://f1tv.formula1.com`, copy the **value** of the `login-session`
  cookie and paste it (the raw subscription JWT is accepted too).

## Features

- **Detachable panels**: every panel — timing tower, track map, Times/Gap
  tables, Quali delta cards, each mode's central view (Race, Race 2, Quali,
  Times/Gap, Race trace), session strip, race control, tyre strategy,
  weather, data source, driver selection, Mode box and the
  timeline — has a small title bar with a ⧉ button that pops it out into
  **its own window**, freely movable and resizable, plus a 📌 **pin**
  button that makes the floating window frameless, always-on-top and
  immovable (ideal over a broadcast), and a ⇱ button to dock it back where
  it was (a floating central view leaves a dock-back placeholder in its
  mode). The **Panels…** button chooses which panels are visible — the
  choice is global and independent of the active mode, so **any
  combination of panels** can be assembled; floating panels stay open
  across modes and keep refreshing (e.g. the timing tables while watching
  the Race chart). The whole layout is **persistent**: window geometry,
  splitters and each panel's docked/floating state, position, size and
  pinned flag are reapplied exactly as they were on the next start.
- **Layout profiles**: Panels… → *Layout profiles* saves the complete current
  arrangement (visible panels, floating windows with position/size/pin,
  splitters and window geometry) under a name — e.g. "Race 3 monitors",
  "Quali compact" — and reapplies it with one click.
- **Session strip** (banner above the charts, detachable like everything
  else): meeting/session name, live **track-status badge**
  (clear/yellow/SC/VSC/red), **LAP n/total** (races) and the **session clock**
  (`ExtrapolatedClock`), plus the latest race-control message colored by
  flag.
- **Race control panel**: chronological log of every official message —
  flags, SC/VSC deployments, investigations and penalties — with session
  timestamps and lap numbers, colored by flag.
- **Tyre strategy panel**: one bar per driver (ordered by position) with the
  stints colored by compound (F1 convention) and the stint length inside,
  clipped to the race distance, with a dashed line at the leader's current
  lap. The tower also shows each car's **current compound and tyre age**
  next to the driver code. Live data comes from `TimingAppData`; replay uses
  Fast-F1 laps.
- **Pit lane panel**: who is in the pit lane **right now**, the compound
  they entered on, and two live clocks — total time in the lane and time
  stationary (speed 0, from telemetry). The tower also shows each driver's
  **last pit visit**: lap, time spent in the lane and time stopped (in
  yellow while the car is still in the lane). Live detection uses the
  official `InPit` flag; replay pairs Fast-F1 `PitInTime`/`PitOutTime`.
- **Notification manager**: popup toasts (bottom-right, auto-dismiss) and a
  log panel for session events — pit in / pit out (with lane and stopped
  times), session fastest lap, **car stopped on track** (speed 0 outside
  the pits, sustained), yellow flag, safety car, virtual safety car, red
  flag and stewards' **penalties**. Each category can be toggled
  individually and popups can be disabled; on connect, pre-existing history
  sets a baseline silently (no notification flood), and timeline seeks
  never re-announce past events.
- **Weather panels**: current values (air, track, wind, rain) plus a
  **weather evolution chart** — air/track temperature above and wind speed
  below, with rain shaded — where the X axis is the **leader's race lap**
  during races or the minutes since the session start otherwise.
- **Tower font size**: A− / A+ buttons in the tower header scale its font
  and row heights (persisted).
- **Pause and hot speed change** (demo/replay): the ⏸ button next to the
  timeline pauses/resumes, and the speed selector can be changed at any
  moment without reconnecting.
- **Timeline** (replay only): a slider below the charts seeks to any point of
  the session; jumping rebuilds the whole state up to that instant (drivers,
  selection and the target lap are kept) and playback continues from there. A
  **ruler marks the start of every lap** (numbered adaptively); clicking a
  mark jumps straight to that lap. Pit stops show as diamonds (driver color),
  flag/SC periods as colored bands and rain as a thin blue stripe. The
  timeline stays active after the replay ends so you can seek back.
- **Timing tower** (right panel, above the map): broadcast-style rows —
  position and driver code on the team color, positions gained/lost, DRS
  status, gear/RPM/speed, **LAST/BEST pills** (purple = session best,
  green = personal best), interval to the car ahead and gap to the leader
  (or "+nL" when lapped), plus the **mini-sector dashes** with the sector
  times below (official feed segments when live; computed against personal
  and session bests elsewhere). Each row also shows the pit-stop count
  ("P n" next to the interval) and an **AVG5/AVG10** column (average of the
  last 5/10 laps, excluding pit in/out laps). The header shows the leader's
  lap, a track-status badge and the weather. Narrow panels drop the outer
  blocks first — widen the splitter to see everything. Gaps only compute
  with real positions: at the
  start, telemetry does not know each car's exact grid slot, so gaps begin at
  the end of sector 1 of lap 1 — the first fixed point common to all cars —
  using a grid offset estimated by projecting car positions onto the track.
- **Weather**: air and track temperature, wind and rain in the status bar
  (synchronized with the replayed instant).
- **Browsable session picker**: the GP field is a combo with the year's
  calendar (loaded in the background via Fast-F1); free typing still works.
- **Stint summary** (Degradation tab): average pace and degradation slope
  (s/lap, linear fit) per stint and compound, next to the lap-time vs
  tyre-age chart (one series per stint, colored by compound).
- **Tyres and strategy**: the "By lap" table tints every cell by compound,
  adds the tyre age in parentheses and marks pit-stop laps with "P" (live:
  `TimingAppData` stints and official pit-stop counter; replay: Fast-F1).
- **Flags and Safety Car**: background bands on the gap chart and the
  timeline, and the tower's header badge while yellow/SC/VSC/red is active.
  While a marshal sector is under yellow flag, that stretch of the **track
  map is painted yellow** (replay: race control messages + Fast-F1 marshal
  sectors).
- **Official mini-sectors** (Times/Gap → "Official µ" tab): the colored
  dashes of the official timing feed, per driver and in track order —
  purple = session best, green = personal best, yellow = completed without
  improving, blue = pit lane. Carried by the Live and Capture sources
  (existing capture files already contain them).
- **Real corners** ("Corners" tab): minimum speed at each numbered corner of
  the circuit (T1, T2, … from Fast-F1 `circuit_info`), rolling over the
  current lap and colored against the reference; corners are also labelled on
  the map.
- **Track map** (right panel, below the tower): the track outline with each
  selected driver's current position (dot + code + 5-second trail fading
  toward its tail, toggleable), synchronized with the same clock as the
  charts. In demo and replay the outline is immediate; live, it builds itself
  once a car completes a lap (`Position.z` feed).
- **Chart ↔ map correlation**: hovering a chart shows a ring on the map at
  the corresponding track point; hovering the map outline shows a vertical
  reference line on the active chart at the corresponding lap meter.
- **Chart interactions**: crosshair tooltip with every visible series' value
  at the cursor; double-click a line to hide it (double-click empty space to
  restore); optional text labels on significant peaks (straight-end top
  speeds above, corner minimum speeds below); the **X window** selector sets
  the axis width in laps for Race and Times/Gap (each mode remembers its
  own).
- **Smooth rendering**: 30 fps refresh; sliding windows and each series' tip
  interpolate between telemetry batches (never predicting ahead of real
  data), so lines draw continuously and precisely.
## Usage (development)

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\pip install -r requirements.txt
.\run.ps1
```

1. Pick a source and press **Connect**.
2. Check the drivers you want to chart — the list is alphabetical and has a
   **Select all** (teammates share the team color and are distinguished by
   line style).
3. Switch mode and channel at will; in **Quali**, pick the target driver and
   lap (each lap shows its time) and press **Set**.

## Windows executable

```powershell
.\build.ps1
```

Produces `dist\F1LiveTelemetry\` with **two executables** —
`F1LiveTelemetry.exe` (visualizer) and `capture\F1TelemCapture.exe`
(capturer, its own `_internal`) — plus `dist\F1LiveTelemetry-win64.zip`,
ready to upload as the GitHub release asset. No Python required.

If **Inno Setup 6** is installed (`winget install JRSoftware.InnoSetup`),
the build also produces `dist\F1LiveTelemetry-setup.exe`: a proper installer
that installs into `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\F1LiveTelemetry` (no admin
required, so the auto-updater keeps working), creates Start-menu and
optional desktop shortcuts, registers the `f1telemetry://` protocol for the
F1TV sign-in extension and provides an uninstaller.

## Automatic updates

Both the visualizer and the capturer check the
[latest GitHub release](https://github.com/frborda/F1-Live-Telemetry/releases)
shortly after startup, and on demand via the **vX.Y.Z** button in the status
bar (bottom-right corner of each window). When a newer version exists, a
dialog shows its release notes and offers **Download and install**, with the
**main app and the capturer selectable separately**: the zip is downloaded to
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\f1telem\updates`, verified against the sha256 digest
published by GitHub, and an unattended script applies what you picked — the
main app is swapped once it closes and relaunched (automatic rollback if the
copy fails; see `update.log`), while the capturer — its own executable and
folder — is **never interrupted**: if it is recording, the installer waits in
the background (up to 60 min) and replaces it as soon as it is closed.
Updating only the capturer doesn't even close the main app.
**Skip this version** silences that release; the startup check can be turned
off from the same dialog (`updates.check_on_startup` in `config.json`).
Running from source only opens the releases page.

Publishing a release: bump `__version__` in `src/f1telem/__init__.py`, run
`.\build.ps1`, create a GitHub release tagged `vX.Y.Z` and upload
`dist\F1LiveTelemetry-win64.zip` (keep that asset name).

## Tests

```

## Technical notes

- Live distance is integrated trapezoidally from speed; lap length is
  estimated as the median of observed laps (in replay it is computed exactly
  from Fast-F1 data).
- Lap/sector/microsector times are interpolated from the crossing instant of
  24 distance marks per lap. With ~4-5 Hz telemetry the accuracy is about
  ±0.1 s — good for comparisons, not official timing. When official sector
  times are available (replay: Fast-F1 laps; live/capture: the timing feed),
  the app locates the **real S1/S2 boundaries** on track — interpolating
  where each car was at the instant it set each sector time, median across
  laps and drivers — and anchors the marks to them; each microsector is 1/8
  of its sector. Each lap's marks are also scaled to the length it really
  integrated between finish-line crossings. On top of that, **as soon as
  each official sector/lap time is published, the tables show that exact
  value** — interpolation only covers what is not timed yet (the rolling
  current lap and microsectors). In replay all timed laps therefore match
  the official timing to the millisecond (verified against a full
  qualifying: 22/22 classification positions identical); live, official
  values arrive seconds after each crossing, and the official S1 is also
  used to re-anchor each lap's frame, cutting the error the feed latency
  introduces in the interpolated values. Without official sector times,
  sectors fall back to distance thirds of the lap. The gap between cars is the time difference
  when passing the same track position, with each lap anchored to its own
  finish-line crossing.
- Fast-F1 cache: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\f1telem\cache`. Settings:
  `%APPDATA%\f1telem\config.json`.
